# 3d-Java-Game
This is a class long project that my group and I worked on to complete. 
From this experience I learned quite a bit from working with others as well as how to document code in an organized manor.

What I contributed to the project:
I contributed the network interaction to the project both client side and server side. On top of that I also added the interpolation between
points to further smooth the entity updates on the screen.

What I learned from this project:
Everyone has a different idea about how things should be handled and as such every conversation must be entered in a respectful manor. 
I learned the importance of staying up to date on git and relaying changes to group members. I learned that the easiest way isn't always the
best way as well.
